      My Dear Dream-Queen [Pikachu],

i have been sitting here trying to put into words something that I’ve been feeling deeply for a while now. There are some moments in 
life when words fail to capture everything you want to say, but today, I’ll try my best.
<br>
<br>
First, I want to tell you how grateful I am to have met you. In a world where we often feel like we’re rushing, meeting you has given me a reason to pause. You’ve brought a warmth into my life that I didn’t realize I was missing, and it feels like everything I’ve been through, all my experiences, and every twist in my path led me to you.
<br>
<br>
With you, life feels brighter, and the future looks beautiful. I’m so inspired by the way you see the world, your kindness, and your patience. These are qualities that I value deeply, and I’ve often thought about what it would be like to share a life, a family, and a future with someone like you.

<br>
<br>
So, today, I want to ask you something that I’ve thought about for a long time. I want to walk this journey of life together with you. Through the ups and downs, I want to be by your side, to support you, to cherish you, and to build a life filled with love, laughter, and mutual respect.
<br>
<br>
Marriage, to me, is not just a commitment; it’s a promise to always be there, to nurture each other’s dreams, and to create a partnership that is grounded in love, trust, and respect. I believe that we both have those qualities, and I know that together, we could build something truly beautiful.

<br>
<br>
I don’t promise that everything will be perfect, but I do promise that I’ll always be there. I’ll strive to make you smile every day and do whatever I can to support you through anything life may bring. I’ll cherish you and make sure that you always feel loved and valued. And I’ll honor the person that you are and who you wish to become.

<br>
<br>
I’ve thought about what kind of partner I want to be for you and what kind of life I want to build with you. And my heart is full of hope and excitement about all the memories we can make together.

<br>
<br>
So, I’m here, with all my heart, asking you to consider spending your life with me. Will you marry me?
<br>
<br>
With all my love and respect,
Your Rockey......
