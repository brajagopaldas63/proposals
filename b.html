        Dear Pasandida [Pikachu],

        I find myself struggling to put my feelings into words because, with you, my heart speaks a language that goes beyond what words can capture. But today, I want to try because there’s something profoundly important I wish to ask you, and I need you to know how deeply and sincerely I mean every word.
        
        When I look back on the journey that led me to you, it feels like every moment, every choice, and every experience brought me closer to this very day. The countless hours I spent studying, the career I built at Microsoft, the places I’ve seen, and the people I’ve met—none of it compares to the joy, warmth, and purpose I feel when I’m with you. You’ve become not only the love of my life but also my best friend, my confidante, my muse, and my greatest cheerleader.
        
        In every conversation we have, I see how you bring out the best in me. I feel more alive, more capable, and more inspired simply because you believe in me. It’s in the little things, too—your laughter that brightens my day, your patience in listening to my never-ending stories, and the gentle ways you remind me of what truly matters. I’ve come to realize that my dreams are no longer just my own; they’re intertwined with yours.
        
        You might wonder why I’m choosing now, this very moment, to write these words. But as I look at the life I’m building, I know with absolute certainty that it’s incomplete without you by my side. My heart has never been so sure of anything, and my love for you has never felt as true, steady, and enduring as it does today.
        
        So, here I am, with my heart in my hands, asking you to take this next step with me. Will you marry me, and make me the happiest man alive? I want to build a life with you that’s filled with laughter, adventure, quiet moments, and all the love we’ve yet to discover. I want to cherish you, support you, and grow with you through every season of life.
        
        No matter where our paths take us, I promise to be there for you through it all. I’ll be the partner who stands by your side, who celebrates your victories, and who holds you close when life throws challenges our way. Together, we’ll make a home, not just a physical space, but a sanctuary filled with love, understanding, and dreams we create together.
        
        Thank you for being my heart’s truest home. Thank you for being my everything. Let’s make the rest of our lives the best journey, hand in hand, heart to heart.
        
        With all my love,
        
        Braja Gopal Padhi
